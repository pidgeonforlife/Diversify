# Diversify

## 💡 Inspiration 💡
According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, only 15.4% of the employees in the tech industry are of minority descent. Of the minorities in the tech industry, 4% of them are women. By giving job searching minorities a platform where they can connect with tech companies directly and search for tech jobs, our app aims to change that!

## ⚙️ What it does ⚙️

You can sign up on the app and connect with employers directly or search the job board and get tailored results based on your location and job query.

## 🛠️ How we built it 🛠️

For the frontend, we used React (JS)/(Bootstrap) and FontAwesome to create a visual and accessible way for users to communicate.

To store user data, we took advantage of Firebase and used Axios to fetch any data required from firebase. We also used react-router-dom to handle routing inside of React(JS).

For the recommendation feature, we used Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn to preprocess our data. We trained our model using Sklearn on 21,000 different job listings.

## 😣 Challenges we ran into 😣

We were plagued with challenges throughout BCHacks because 3 of us are first time hackers.

Some Challenges include:

Getting reactJS to work on everyone's computer
Organizing schedules
Finding a good dataset for job listings
Getting multiplier reactJS pages to work together seamlessly

## 🎉 Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉

As a team consisting of 3 first time hackers and 1 semi-experienced hacker, we accomplished A LOT during the past 24 hours!

Some notable accomplishments include:

Figuring out how Github push, pulls and branches work (Finally understand Git!!)
Designing the app from scratch (we just found out about figma)
Using so many tools, languages and frameworks at once, and making them work together :D

## ⏭️What's next for Diversify ⏭️

Implement a chat feature so users can talk amongst themselves and employers
Expand on the search feature (add more search terms)
Make our job board more aesthetically pleasing
Have a 'posts' area where users can talk about their experiences and give advice
Possibly have a resume builder built in to the app to help users with their application process
